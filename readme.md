## Assignment Task:

## Create Readme

You have to create a `Readme.md` file. and write down following questions. Dont Try to copy paste from AI Tools. Just write what you know about these. If you don't know , then search , learn , understand and then write.

### 6. Answer the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

  Ans: getElementById is used for to target one html element, getElementsByClassName is used for multiple html element and it is an array, querySelector is used for single class and it always select the first element, querySelectorAll is used for to get all the same class elements.

2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?

   Ans: To create and insert a new element into the DOM:
   First, we have to use document.createElement() to make the new element.
   Then, we can put text or attributes on it (like innerText, classList.add(), etc.).
   Finally, we attach it to an existing element in the page using something like appendChild() or append().

3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?

   Ans: Event Bubbling is a mechanism of the DOM (Document Object Model). When an event is triggered on an element, that same event bubbles up through the DOM tree towards its ancestors (from the child element to the parent element).

4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

   Ans: Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element instead of multiple listeners on child elements. This method takes advantage of event bubbling, allowing the parent to handle events triggered by its children. It improves performance and simplifies code management and can add element after the DOM load.
5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?

   Ans: preventDefault() prevent input form reload in browser, stopPropagation() is used to prevent bubbling up to parent element.
